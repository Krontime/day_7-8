                    <p>Doctor Who follows the adventures of the primary character, a rogue Time Lord from 
                    the planet Gallifrey, who goes by the name "the Doctor". He fled Gallifrey in a stolen 
                    TARDIS – "Time and Relative Dimension in Space" – a time machine that travels by 
                    materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast 
                    interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a "chameleon circuit" 
                    intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due 
                    to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British police box.</p>
                    <p>The Doctor often finds events that pique his curiosity as he tries to prevent evil 
                    forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only his ingenuity and

                    and often brings one or more companions to share these adventures. His companions are 
                    usually humans, as he has found a fascination with planet Earth, and he frequently 
                    collaborates with the international military task force UNIT when the Earth itself is 
                    threatened. As a Time Lord, the Doctor is centuries-old and has the ability to 
                    regenerate when his body is mortally damaged, taking on a new appearance and 
                    personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during his travels,

            <h4>The Doctor</h4>
            <p>The Tenth Doctor has been extremely popular amongst the Doctor Who fandom. 
            He received critical acclaim for his complexity and humanity and is considered one of 
            the greatest incarnations of the character. The BBC went as far as to consider ending 
            the show in 2010, thinking it would fail without Tennant.</p>
            
            <h4>Sonic Screwdriver???</h4>
            <p>The sonic screwdriver is a multifunctional fictional tool in 
            Doctor Who and its spin-offs, used by the Doctor. Like the TARDIS, it has become one of the 
            icons of the programme, and spin-off media such as The Sarah Jane Adventures and Torchwood 
            have replicated its functions in devices such as the sonic lipstick, sonic blaster, sonic 
            probe, and sonic modulator.</p>
            <p>Throughout the programme, there have been many different versions of the sonic 
            screwdriver, as with subsequent Doctors the design of it was changed. It has also been 
            destroyed on a number of occasions, thus leading to the introduction of the next model. 
            Not all iterations of the Doctor have used the sonic screwdriver on screen; the Fifth 
            Doctor in fact opted not to replace his after it was destroyed.</p>
            
            <h4>Companions</h4>    
            <p>In Doctor Who and related works, the term "companion" refers to a 
            character who travels with, or shares the adventures of the Doctor. In most Doctor Who 
            stories, the primary companion acts as an audience surrogate. They provide the lens 
            through which the viewer is introduced to the series. The companion character often 
            furthers the story by asking questions and getting into trouble, or by helping, rescuing, 
            or challenging the Doctor. This designation is applied to a character by the show's 
            producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional 
            terminology. Until the modern revival of the series in 2005, the term was rarely used 
            on-screen. The Doctor also refers to the show's other leads as his "friends" or 
            "assistants"; the British press have also used the latter term.</p>
